# React Food Order App

 * <h2> https://react-food-order-app-sigma.vercel.app/ </h2>
 * In this project, I've created a food order app where 
   * foods are fetched from Firebase Realtime Database, 
   * you can add as much as food to your cart,
   * when you open the cart, you can also edit amounts,
   * after you decided, you can send the order to the backend by entering your information (name, city, etc.)  
   * there are validation checks in the forms
   * you can also search for food
